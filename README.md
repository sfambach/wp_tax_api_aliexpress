# Taxmod AliExpress

AliExpress connection for the [Taxonomy Modeller](https://github.com/sfambach/wp-taxonomy-modeler) (WordPress plugin).

**Status 0.0.1 (needs modeller 0.1.81 and [Taxmod Mail](https://github.com/sfambach/wp_tax_mail) 0.6.0 or later):
reads order confirmations, shipping and delivery mails from the mailbox of Taxmod Mail and hands them to the modeller's inbox. A shipping mail carries no order date.**

Every shop connection is a module of its own, whether it reads mails or an API; Taxmod Mail only fetches and files
the mails (D-1006, [concept](https://github.com/sfambach/wp-taxonomy-modeler/blob/main/docs/pakete/import/module-schnitt.md)).
The reader moved here from Taxmod Mail unchanged.

## Setup

1. Install and set up Taxmod Mail (mailbox access).
2. Activate this module. *Taxonomy Modeller → Configuration → AliExpress* shows under «Mail» which mails it reads.

## Development

`composer install`, then `vendor/bin/phpunit` (core suite, no WordPress). The sample mails in `tests/Core/fixtures`
are synthetic.
